/**
 * A mobile is a hanging room decoration consisting of sticks with a specified stick weight on which
 * further mobiles are attached (recursive structure). The actual decorations (e.g. stars with
 * a specified weight) are the leaf nodes.
 *
 * Example:
 *                     |
 *              +------5---+----+
 *              |          |    |
 *        +-----2--+--+    *    *
 *        |        |  |    12   5
 *        |        |  *
 *        *        |  2
 *        7        |
 *              +--1--+
 *              |     |
 *              *     *
 *              3     3
 *
 * Readable representation as string: 5[2[*7, 1[*3, *3], *2], *12, *5]
 * Please, do not change this interface definition!
